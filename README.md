# Deep Learning Assignment - Implementing Neural Networks from Scratch
This repository contains the implementation of a standard deep neural network and a residual neural network (ResNet) from scratch as part of the Deep Learning course assignment at Ben-Gurion University (BGU).

## Project Overview
In this assignment, we were tasked with implementing deep neural networks without relying on popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. The project includes:

Implementation of DNN & ResNet architectures, including the forward pass and the backpropagation.
Implementation of the Gradient and Jacobian test used in the backpropagation process.
Evaluation of these networks on the datasets provided in the "datasets" folder. 

## Datasets
There are 3 datasets provided:

1. A two dimensional data “SwissRoll” with two classes (colored red and blue).

2. A two dimensional data “Peaks” with 5 classes (five colors).

3. A five dimensional data “GMM” data with 5 classes (five colors). For illustration, the
figure below has n = 3, but in the actual data n = 5.

## Results
The results we obtained from running the implemented models can be found in the "plots" directory.
